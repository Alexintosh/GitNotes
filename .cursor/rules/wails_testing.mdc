# Wails Application Testing

## Required Testing After Changes

- **Always Run Development Server After Changes**
  - Run `wails3 dev` to verify application starts without errors
  - Required after any code change before committing
  - Especially important for Go backend changes and frontend-backend integration points

## Testing Process

- **Frontend-Only Changes**
  ```bash
  # Run the application to verify UI renders correctly
  wails3 dev
  ```

- **Backend (Go) Changes**
  ```bash
  # Test that backend services compile and function correctly
  wails3 dev
  ```

- **Integration Points**
  ```bash
  # Verify that frontend can call Go services without errors
  # Test affected functionality through the UI
  wails3 dev
  ```

## Common Errors to Watch For

- **Runtime Errors**
  - JavaScript errors in the browser console
  - Panics in Go code
  - Missing function bindings between frontend and backend

- **Build Errors**
  - TypeScript compilation errors
  - Go build failures
  - Missing dependencies

## Automated Testing (When Applicable)

- **For Critical Components**
  ```bash
  # Run Go tests for backend code
  go test ./...
  
  # Run frontend tests if configured
  npm run test
  ```

- **Important**: Manual verification with `wails3 dev` is still required even when automated tests pass
