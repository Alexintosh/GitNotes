# Wails 3 Development Workflow

- **Always Use wails3 Command Prefix**
  - Wails 3 commands must use `wails3` prefix, not just `wails`
  - This applies to all development, build, and generation commands
  
- **Running the Application**
  - **✅ DO: Use `wails3 dev` to run the application**
    ```bash
    # Run the full application (backend + frontend)
    wails3 dev
    ```
  - **❌ DON'T: Use `npm run dev` or other frontend-only commands**
    ```bash
    # WRONG: This only runs the frontend, not the Go backend
    cd frontend && npm run dev
    ```
    
- **Fixing Port Conflicts**
  - If port 9245 (default Wails dev port) is in use:
    ```bash
    # Find the process using the port
    lsof -i :9245
    # Kill the process
    kill <PID>
    # Then run the app
    wails3 dev
    ```
  - **Never change ports** in development unless explicitly required
  
- **Building the Application**
  - **✅ DO: Use `wails3 build` for production builds**
    ```bash
    wails3 build
    ```
  
- **Generating Bindings**
  - When Go backend service changes require updated TypeScript bindings:
    ```bash
    wails3 generate bindings
    ```
  
- **Debugging**
  - Use Wails dev server console for both frontend and backend logs
  - Backend (Go) logs appear in the terminal running `wails3 dev`
  - Frontend (React) logs appear in the browser console
  
This rule ensures proper integration between the Go backend and React frontend in Wails applications. Using `wails3 dev` starts both the backend and frontend together, properly connecting the frontend to the backend Go services.
