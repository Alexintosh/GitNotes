# Wails 3 Usage Rules

- **Project Uses Wails v3, Not v2**
  - This project is built with Wails v3, despite the CLI tool possibly showing v2.x
  - The configuration file is `wails3.json` not `wails.json`
  - All CLI commands must use `wails3` instead of `wails`

- **Configuration and Structure**
  - Configuration lives in `wails3.json` in the project root
  - Frontend code is in `frontend/` directory
  - Bindings are generated in `frontend/bindings/`

- **Command Usage Examples**
  ```bash
  # ✅ DO: Use wails3 command prefix
  wails3 dev
  wails3 build
  wails3 generate bindings

  # ❌ DON'T: Use wails command prefix
  wails dev     # Incorrect
  wails build   # Incorrect
  wails generate bindings  # Incorrect
  ```

- **Key Differences from Wails v2**
  - Wails v3 uses a new application API
  - The window management approach is different
  - The binding process between frontend and backend has changed
  - System tray integration is more advanced
